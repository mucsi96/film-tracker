# Film Tracker - Contributor guidance

## Code Review Rules

- Review the PR diff for actionable correctness, security, data-loss, and deployment regressions; cite the changed file/line and concrete impact.
- Preserve authentication boundaries, persisted data compatibility, and the project's documented build/test/deploy contracts. Adapt shared patterns to this project's stack.
- Report missing behavioral coverage where it would catch a specific regression; leave formatting and mechanical checks to CI.
